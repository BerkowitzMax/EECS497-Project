                    Food wastage is a big problem not only in the US but also globally. 
                    Such wastage becomes even more outrageous when there are still people 
                    going hungry around the world. According to the United States Department 
                    of Agriculture (USDA), in 2010, there was 133 billion pounds of food 
                    wasted in the US alone. This food waste is costly for both the world’s 
                    budget and the world’s health, as the food wastes’ value in 2010 was 
                    around $161 billion dollars and produced the same amount of greenhouse 
                    gases as 37 million cars. Saving that money from being thrown in landfills 
                    and avoiding that amount of greenhouse gases being produced would have an 
                    enormous impact on the health of our economy and Earth. Another crucial 
                    fact of our current food system that makes this waste even more stinging is 
                    that around 35 million Americans battled hunger and food insecurity in 2019. 
                    This makes it apparent that there is a vital need for reform and improvement 
                    in the current food supply chain.
